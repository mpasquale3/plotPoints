# Plot Points

Plot Points is a small data project that analyzes what makes a book go viral on TikTok. The project uses Python scripts and the Open Library & TMDb APIs to enrich a manually curated dataset with metadata like genres, publishers, publication dates, and adaptation statuses.



## Project Goals

- Identify common characteristics shared by viral books on BookTok.
- Analyze trends by genre, publisher type (indie vs. traditional), adaptation status, and diversity representation.
- Visualize findings using Python and Tableau dashboards.


## Data Sources

- **BookTok** — manually curated trending titles.
- **Open Library API** — for metadata enrichment (page count, publisher, publish year).
- **The Movie Database (TMDb) API** — for checking adaptation status.


## Tech Stack

- **Python** — data collection and enrichment scripts.
- **Pandas** — data cleaning and analysis.
- **Tableau Public** — data visualization.
- **Git & GitHub** — version control.



## Visualizations

All final charts and dashboards are available in the `/visualizations` folder and on Tableau Public (link coming soon).
